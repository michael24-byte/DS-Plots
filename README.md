🔍 Plot Explanations
📈 Univariate Plots
Histogram: Displays the distribution of a single numeric variable by showing the frequency of data points in consecutive intervals.

Boxplot: Summarizes the distribution of a dataset through its quartiles and identifies outliers. Can be used with or without grouping by a categorical variable.

Violin Plot: Combines a boxplot and a kernel density estimate (KDE) to show both summary statistics and data distribution.

Bar Chart: Visualizes the frequency (count) of categories in a single categorical variable (univariate). It can also show aggregated numeric values grouped by categories (bivariate).
